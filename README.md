# Drawing-App

##-> A very simple app that allows you to draw on a `canvas` with friends all over the world.

##->For the moment the app uses only one canvas, everybody that joins the server will be forced to draw their idea/art with the others.

##->Technologies used:
    *p5.js (the drawing engine)
    *nodejs + Express (the server)
    *socket.io (for the fast and scallable communication between clients and server)

##->Future ideas:
####*`Undo` option
####*`Save` option (download on local client computer)
####*`Multiple Canvases` (private + public)
####*`More styling options` (drawing)
####*`Smoother drawings`
####*`Accounts and db` (it will be optional)
